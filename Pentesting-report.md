## Observed security strengths

[...]

## Overall Risk rating

*The overall risk identified to `<CLIENT COMPANY NAME>` as a result of the penetration test is \textcolor{high}{High}. This rating implies an ELEVATED risk of security controls being compromised with the potential for material financial losses, based on two high-risk and several medium vulnerabilities.*

# Technical report

## Scope

The scope for the footprinting phase was all the `<CLIENT COMPANY NAME>` public information that a user could find on the Internet.

The scope for the pentesting and vulnerability assessment services were the following systems:

* localhost (127.0.0.1)
* https://example.org/

* Corporate
* Personal

## Pentesting | Vulnerability assessment

### Localhost - 127.0.0.1

* **Ports (TCP)**: 22, 80
* **Operating system**: Linux

During the web enumeration phase was discovered a company's user searcher, which retrieves information about an employee based on the user company's id.

#### Union SQL Injection
